 <?php echo '<p>Hello World</p>'; ?> 
 <h1>Let's see what we are working with...</h1>
  I'm not so certain what the inner loop might be, but we are getting closer all the time.
  Here is another test from VS Code to GitHub to OpenShift. <br/>
  This time via commandline. <br/>
  This time via WebHook.  <br/>
  How might we get a configMap or Secret value? <br/>
  <?php print_r(parse_ini_file("test.ini")); ?> <br />
  Did it work?
 <?php phpinfo(); ?>
